                    <p class="content"><br>BYG (Book Your Game) is a company that deals with marketing, CRM, websites
                        and apps for gyms in mulitple cities in India. The initial focus of the company was on getting
                        the CRM product up and running resulting in not much design being put into it. The goal of the
                        project was to improve the UX and redo the UI of the product to create a better experience.</p>

                    <p class="content">We wanted the app to be a simpler version of the desktop app that included only
                        features that the user would check frequently or on the go. Red content was removed in the
                        mobile app.
                        Refactoring and rearrangement of content was also needed to make the mobile version a more
                        clean and seamless experience.</p>
