                        This project is an initiative to indentify the issues in the online job application process and

                        decided to use the leftmost one with minor modifications as the colors and design were meant to
                        be
                        soothing which I believe would be valued by job searchers.</p>

                        best elements from the three explorations shown below.</p>

                    <p class="content">During signup all the details necessary for you to find a good job needs to be
                        entered
                        by the user. The app provides a set of resume templates that automatically fills up the resume
                        based on
                        the information enetered. This eases usage for those who find this step difficult.
                        Based on the kind of jobs you are searching for the app also
                        suggests sources that you can search in and provides a common login portal for them all. This
                        avoids
                        the time necessary to find these yourself.</p>

                    <p class="content">The feed contains all the jobs from multiple sources in one place. Graphic cues
                        and
                        content show how close of a match a job is to what you consider your dream job. This makes it
                        easy
                        to quickly scroll through the content.
                        The details page segregates content for easy reading and understanding. The graph on top can
                        give
                        you a quick idea about whether you want to bother reading further which will save a lot of
                        time.</p>

                        reminding them to keep track of and send out follow up mails is one important addition.
                        Job seekers may also be looking for more than one kind of job. The user journey would have to
                        be
                        modified so that there are no conflicts or confusion created because of the different kinds of
