                    <p class="content"><br>One of the major difficulties faced by Chinese students living away from
                        home is
                        getting comfortable in a new environment. A busy schedule and a lack of familiar surroundings
                        can
                        make them feel cut off from their culture and one way in which they try to reconnect is through
                        food. <br><br><b>OUR QUESTION:</b> How could we design a food delivery app that provides
                        home-cooked
                        meals for Chinese students living away from home?</p>

                        creating. Card sorting helped organise all of our main takeaways</p>

                        impressions derived from the survey:
                        <br>1. Price Matters

                    <p class="content">Students liked that the food could be filtered based on region. It was nice and
                        fun to look for the familiar name of their hometown.Rather than having just comments to the
                        chef we added sliders to intimate the
                        flavour you were expecting, to the chef. This was added to make it apparent that
                        personalization was welcome and to give an idea to the users about the kinds of
                        requests they could make to the chef.
                        <br>Chinese people generally expect rice as a side to any main dish that they order. This
                        unique way in which they eat their cuisine needed to be accomodated into the cart page flow.
                        Since this is an app catering to Chinese people in particular, they expected familiar features
                        like access to popular modes of payment available in China.</p>
