            <p class="highlight">plant blindness.</p>
            <p class="general">In 1998, 2 American scientists Wandersee and Schussler coined the term Plant blindness to
                describe the tendency of people to ignore the plants in their environment.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">our dependance on plants makes this an issue.</p>
            <p class="general">In the USA, plants comprise 57% of the federal endangered species list, but plant
                conservation receives less than 4% of expenditure.<br>
                Research has also shown that students do not prefer to study plant science and consequently the number
                of plant science degrees being offered by colleges is on the decline.<br>
                These are just some of the effects of plant blindness.<br><br>
                This trend is alarming is that the solution to solving many issues like global warming, the need for new
                medicines and food security depends on plants and people with expertise in plant science.

            <p class="highlight">plant enthusiasts vs. those who ignore plants.</p>
            <p class="general">An interesting research conducted via twitter that tried to answer the question: What
                differentiates plant scientists and other plant enthusiasts from those who ignore plants?<br>
                The answer was an increased exposure to plants from an early age.<br><br>
                Through inspiring teachers, growing up on a farm, or gardening this exposure is one of the main
                differences between them and those of us who ignore plants.

            <p class="general">With the above research results in mind I started looking into other projects that have
                tried to encourage experiences with plants through participation and exploration outside of formal
                learning environments.<br><br>
                The main insights from the projects I looked into was the idea of encouraging participation to generate
                interest in a topic, the use of storytelling to engage attention and the use of anthropomorphism which
                is the attribution of human characteristics or behaviors to an object to breed empathy for plants.

            <p class="heading">primary research</p>
            <p class="highlight">plant related experiences and increased knowledge.</p>
            <p class="general">My primary research helped me realize the need for plant-related experiences that are
                easily accessible. I visited the Michigan Science Center, a children’s museum. The STEM section was of
                particular interest to me as it focussed on generating interest in science among visitors. What I found
                most interesting though was that while Exhibits on human and animal biology were present there was the
                lack of anything related to plants in the museum except as decoration for the kids play area. I saw a
                similar trend in bookstores as well.<br><br>
                Through conversations with Scott Francisco, the Founder and Director of Pilot Projects Design
                Collective, and reading books on plants, I learnt facts about them that I felt would be interesting to
                convey to an audience to generate interest. I felt that Knowing this knowledge could help humans treat
                plants as living creatures on the same level as animals, which is one of the most significant elements
                causing plant blindness.</p>

            <p class="heading">ideation and prototyping</p>
            <p class="highlight">goal.</p>
            <p class="general">The goal of my ideation and prototyping stage was to find a way to convey through an
                interactive exhibit facts about plants in a way that generates interest in them similar to the way STEM
                exhibits do so for science and techology.<br><br>
                I started by creating a number of initial sketches and ideas
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="full"><img src="images/BTS/5.png"></div>
        <div class="text">
            <p class="highlight">selected concept - first iteration.</p>
            <p class="general">I settled on a concept that focussed on the molecular level of plants to convey the way
                in which the plants respond their environment in specific situations. It conveys what happens beneath
                the seemingly static surface of the plant.<br><br>
                This is the first iteration of my concept. I used the photographs of the molecular structure number of
                different plants taken by the Kew Research Center. The visuals would be animated to react to external
                stimuli like the presence of bees, and water or attacks by pests.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text">
            <p class="highlight">selected concept - second iteration.</p>
            <p class="general">A major concern with the previous iteration was that the visuals were too abstract and
                could not convey that the exhibit was about plants. This led to my second iteration in which I had
                planned to project the same visuals from the previous iteration onto physical forms of plants using
                projection mapping.

        <div class="full"><img src="images/BTS/7.png"></div>
        <div class="text">
            <p class="general">To do this though I would need projectors capable of projection mapping which I did not
                have access to. I decided to instead use animated LED strip lights embedded in large physical plant
                forms to recreate an effect similar to what I could get through projection mapping.

                the exhibit I had started to create with the lights and craft wire.<br><br>
                I experimented with LED animations and the forms for the exhibit. Another thing I looked into was the
                effects different materials would create when placed over the lights.

            <p class="general">With the arrival of COVID-19 I had to pause my work on my exhibit until I found a way to
                represent my idea digitally. I took that opportunity at this time to explore the possibility of how
                people could encounter plant-related experiences beyond the exhibit. It led me to consider using the
                exhibit as a point of entry to a larger and longer experience rather than as a standalone. My focus
                during COVID shifted more towards additional experience.

            <p class="general">I had started exploring how I could recreate the exhibit in a digital format. I explored
                a number of styles with the idea being that in a real world scenario I would be working with a larger
                team of people which would comprise of illustrators whose style would be a good fit for this project. So
                for the purposes of showcasing the concept here I have chosen to use the style of Truf Creatives Flora
                Series.

            <p class="general">I started developing the exhibit by creating a black and white composition made of
                graphics inspired by common garden and house plants. I also explored possibilities for color and style.
                Following this, I selected a style to apply to the composition to create the final exhibit design.
