            <p class="general">HyperCard is a multimedia authoring environment that empowered non-programmers to share
                ideas using new interactive media called HyperCard stacks. This allowed users to define what they wanted
                out of the system, offering a high degree of personalization.

            <p class="general">Looking into the different areas in which such personalization would be useful and
                appreciated, I thought of smart home interfaces.<br><br>
                1. Smart home interfaces cannot truly offer you a way to customize the interface and interactions to
                suit individual habits and routines.<br>
                2. Interfaces today are designed to make you feel less.<br>
                3. Interfaces are functional but rarely offer delight or relaxation.

                interface that is capable of recognizing a variety of complex touch interactions.

                Using this consumers can have the option of creating their own interface out of any surface
                (non-metallic) surface in their home to control smart devices / appliances.

                2. It provides more choice in texture, style, aesthetics and interactivity.<br><br>

                3. There is also the possibility to create an interface that has additional values like relaxation, fun,
                and more for the user.<br><br>

                4. It opens up the possibility of exploring unique interactions that are not possible with traditional

                5. It encourages materiality.
