                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <h3>Using Word and Excel documents for the program</h3>

                <div class="right">
                    <p>Peppercorn had developed a job search program that would enable candidates to discover what they wanted for their future while helping them articulate themselves effectively to land the right job. Currently, the program consists of multiple Word and Excel documents. These documents contain instructions for the program and tasks to complete. The issues were that:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Using Word and Excel documents was complex requiring someone to walk the clients through the necessary steps.</p></li>
                        <li><p>The candidate has to do work that could be made easier with a system that uses a database.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Large documents filled with content can be intense and intimidating.</p></li>

                <div class="right">
                    <p>The initial goal was to understand the platform and the content. Peppercorn had already done a lot of research on the market, competitors, and personas. I spent some time looking through what they had while also exploring other secondary research resources.
                        <br><br>
                        I also spent some time looking into LinkedIn Pro Finder to understand what clients were looking for when they choose a career coach.</p>

                <div class="right">
                    <p>After a first pass through the document, I started organizing the content into different phases to separate it into clearly defined chunks with clear goals for the candidates to accomplish. This process and the next were done in collaboration with the creator of this program. We ended up with an overall architecture for the platform, future feature ideas, and an idea for how much and what to include in our MVP.</p>

                    <p>Following initial outlines I developed wireframes for the different kinds of pages that would be needed in the platform. This helped aid discussions around what would work best and discover potential usability issues. Our initial focus for the MVP was to develop Phase 1 and 2 of the product and the wireframes were focussed on them as well.</p>

                    <h4>Learn to prioritize some and let go of others</h4>
                    <p>In a startup there are too many things that need to be done but only so much time to do it. Pixel perfect designs are less important then ensuring the we have made the right UX decisions. Also a small startup team means that sometimes effective communication is faster and a better use of time than creating every single screen needed for the platform. I had to decide to leave some as wireframes and work with the developer later to audit the design if needed.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Focus on the MVP</h4>
                    <p>It is easy to lose sight of the main goal if we are not clear about defining what needs to be done now and what can be left for later. We had to choose the pieces of the product that would provide the most value and set us apart from competitors.</p>
