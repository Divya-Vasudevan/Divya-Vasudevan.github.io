                    <h2>The Goal</h2>
                    <h3>Redesign the program for web and mobile platforms to make it accessible to a larger audience</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="right">
                    <p>Peppercorn Discovery is a program created to help candidates identify what they want out of their career and identify the words to articulate that well to companies and recruiters.
                     The program had been presented through multiple Word and Excel documents, which were not easy to follow without the help of a coach or someone else who was familiar with the program.
                     <br><br>
                        The goal was to move the progam to the web and reformat it so that it is easy for a candidate to complete without additional help. This would also make the platform accessible to a larger audience.

                    <h2>Information Gathering and Research</h2>
                    <h3>Went through research done by Peppercorn and learnt from the founder more about the program and how the candidates responded to it</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="right">
                    <p>The initial goal was to understand the platform and the content better. Peppercorn had already done a lot of research on the market, competitors, and personas. I spent some time understanding the background from what they had while also looking into LinkedIn Pro Finder to understand what clients were looking for when they choose a career coach.
                        <br><br>
                        I also spent time with the founder to understand the program itself while gathering information on how candidates responded to the program. Main questions I focussed on:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Where did candidates get stuck?</p></li>
                        <li><p>What did they find most valuable?</p></li>
                        <li><p>Tips and tricks that helped them get through difficult sections?</p></li>
                        <li><p>What they liked and disliked?</p></li>
                        <li><p>What changed with different types of users: those just starting out, those pivoting to a different roles, and those who are unsure of their next steps?</p></li>

                        <li><p>The program which was initially one large chunk, I separated into phases based on the kind of mindset the candidate would need to be in to complete the program.</p></li>
                        <li><p>All the individual exercises had to be looked through and the content reformatted to take advantage of the lack of limitations that the Google docs and Excel sheets had placed on it. </p></li>
                        <li><p>Additional help functionality had to be built in where candidates were most likely to require it.</p></li>

                    <p>Every module started with a video explaining the ideal mindset to be in to effectively complete it.
                        I chose this medium rather than the text content that was provided in the original as listening to the coach explain this during sessions was a lot more compelling and easier for the candidates to grasp.

                        <b>Action Taken:</b> We decided to include content encouraging this action throughout the program itself in the form of blogs with links to contact coaches. Needed more research and content revisions.

                    <p>The STAR format was heavily restructured from pages of text to make easier. It was converted into dropdowns and individual instructions were separated for each part.<br><br>
                        <b>Testing Results:</b> Candidates found this section a lot harder as the new structure limited free flow of thought.<br><br>
                        <b>Action Taken:</b> This section was completely removed from this module of the program. We added an open text entry with minimal formatting instructions (simplified from the document version) later on in the program when candidates are clearer about what they want in their career.

                    <p>In a startup there are too many things that need to be done but only so much time to do it. Pixel perfect designs are less important then ensuring the we have made the right UX decisions. Also a small startup team means that sometimes effective communication is faster and a better use of time than creating every single screen needed for the platform. I had to decide to leave some as wireframes and work with the developer later to audit the design if needed.</p>
