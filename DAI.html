                    <h3>Add a DAI monitoring dashboard to an existing analytics product.</h3>

                    <h4>What is DAI?</h4>
                    <p>Dynamic ad insertion(DAI) is the act of adding advertisements to a program asset in real-time, rather than pre-programming it. 
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Create a dashboard to facilitate the monitoring of DAI - keep track of usage metrics and ensuring that the functionality is working accurately.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Ensure that the UI is similar to the parent analytics product</p></li>

                    <h3>Initial designs of major features were used as a visual aid to further discussions about functionality and understand requirements better</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="right">
                    <p>Since I already had a guide for the interface design, I moved from low fidelity wireframes to a high fidelity first draft. I only included some major features that had clear directions on how and where it would be used. This draft also helped act as a visual aid to discuss clarifications about the remaining functionality with the stakeholders.  The discussion was centered around:</p>
                    <ul><li><p>A detailed look into how the dashboard would be used.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Identifying areas of improvement which could mean additional features or edits to existing ones.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Ensuring that the development team and stakeholders were on the same page with respect to the functionality and use of the features designed.</p></li>

                    <p>Based on the information architecture and the previous feedback, I iterated the designs to complete the final version. I also created a clickable prototype for stakeholder presentation. The prototype would also help developers to understand the user flow more easily.</p>

                    <h4>Ensure you are included in early conversations about requirements</h4>
                    <p>In spite of working closely with the developers and stakeholders not being present during the initial conversations was a large gap to cover. Trying to suggest changes after decisions have been made is harder than providing suggestions before things have been set in stone. There are also many questions that developers would not think to ask but is important for a designer to know. When possible it is essential that the team knows that the designer needs to be included in these meetings and why it would be valuable for them to do so.</p>
