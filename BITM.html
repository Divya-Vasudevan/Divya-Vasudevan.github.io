            <p class="general">My initial plan revolved around creating an activity in the library that would encourage
                reading. I looked into existing case studies to better inform myself of what currently exists and where
                opportunities lay to innovate.

            <p class="general">Webnovel is an app that supports amateur authors. It is a forum in which the author and
                reader are in close contact. This allows for discussion and events around the characters and plotlines
                that could influence the direction of the story that traditional reading does not allow.

            <p class="general">Growing by Reading is a library program developed by the Hippocampus Reading Foundation
                in Bangalore, India. It aims to asses the reading level of children through activities and suggests the
                best reading materials based on that. This is to ensure that children are not put off by reading due to
                starting with books that are too hard or uninteresting for them.

            <p class="general">The library period in schools are structures such that students are allowed to pick a
                book in the first five to ten minutes of class. The remainder is spent reading whatever they have
                picked. Some issues with this:<br>
                1. Students may pick an uninteresting book that they have to read for the remainder of the class.<br>
                2. Many libraries have locked bookshelves that requires the librarians permission before a book can be
                taken out.<br>
                3. The process of randomly selecting a book is overwhelming and uninspired.<br>
                4. Libraries may not be able to meet the needs of their readers because of the lack of budget and
                understanding of the right resources necessary<br>

            <p class="general">The significant elements of the library class would include an activity through which the
                librarian can gain an understanding of the students’ interests and reading level. This information would
                be used to provide suggestions to reading resources they are more likely to enjoy. These suggestions
                also help librarians identify where the library collection falls short of meeting the students’ needs.
                The design will focus on how to provide suggestions and make use of them rather than the activity.</p>

            <p class="general">An activity designed and executed by the librarian helps the system understand the
                reading level and interests of each student. Based on this information, a private digital space is
                created for them to explore. This space contains works that match the students’ preferences. Students
                can navigate the online space like they would a physical room by moving through the room using arrow
                keys.</p>

            <p class="general">A 3-dimensional view of activity statistics and corresponding reading materials present
                in the library provides an easy way to analyze potential areas for improvement quickly. Zooming in and
                out offers more or less detail, respectively, so that better decisions can be made about improving the
                library offerings.</p>

            <p class="heading">conclusion</p>
            <p class="general">1. Interesting displays can engage students in exploring books online in a way that might
                be impossible in the physical library space.<br>
                2. The experience allows students to move around and engage not just with books but also each other.<br>
                3. Fun online experiences and meetups within the library can help turn it into a hub that encourages
                reading and critical thinking in students.<br>
                4. Librarians have a clearer picture of what their students need. This also enables librarians to work
                within their given budget better.</p>
