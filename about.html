                        I did my bachelor's in Information and Communication Technology, following which, I worked as a
                        backend developer at ZOHO corporation for two years. Though the work there was challenging and
                        in
                        line with my interests, I found myself unhappy with how far removed from the users it was. This
                        led
                        me to discover interaction design.
                        <br><br>Following a period of self-learning, I did two internships.
                        The
                        first was in Chennai with Tablo Noir where I focussed mostly on graphic design and the other was

                        BYG in Bangalore, where I was involved in graphic design and web design and development. My
                        experiences there led me to want to learn and explore more, leading me to an MFA in CCS.<br>

                        me about various stories from Indian mythology and provided a creative outlet for me.<br>
